# MontgomeryCounty_SaltRoute_Report
This project is a collaboration between Montgomery County Department of Transportation – Highway Services and myself. The Department of Environmental Protection also provided datasets and are responsible for monitoring stream/watershed health conditions. The main goal of this project is to identify DOT’s salt route usage against watershed areas during snowstorms to identify relationships between salt usage on the watershed condition.
