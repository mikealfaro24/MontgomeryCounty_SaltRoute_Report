# 🗺️ Interactive Web Map: Snowplow Routes & Watershed Health in Montgomery County

## 📍 Project Overview

This capstone data science project explores the environmental impact of snowplow route distribution on watershed health in Montgomery County, Maryland. In collaboration with the Department of Transportation–Highway Services (DOT) and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the project integrates spatial datasets to create an interactive web map that overlays snowplow routes with watershed and stream health data.

The goal is to provide decision-makers and environmental analysts with a tool to better understand where plow routes intersect with vulnerable watersheds, ultimately supporting more sustainable and informed winter road treatment strategies.

## 🧾 Data Sources

- **DOT Snowplow Route Shapefiles:**  
  Snow routes for seven regions: Silver Spring, Bethesda, Colesville, Gaithersburg East, Gaithersburg West, Poolesville, and Damascus. Each shapefile contains 300–2,500 records and over 30 route-specific attributes.

- **DEP Watershed & Stream Data:**  
  - Watershed boundaries shapefile  
  - Stream/tributary health status dataset collected by Montgomery County’s biological monitoring team

> ⚠️ Salt/brine usage data was unavailable, but the current datasets still provide valuable environmental context.
